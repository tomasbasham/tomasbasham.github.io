      <p>My name is Tomas Basham. I am a Software Developer at Your Golf
      Travel; a travel company offering exclusive golfing experiences.</p>

      <p>I have a strong programming skill set with particular attention to Go
      and Ruby; focussing on microservices and Ruby on Rails frontends.
      Additionally I have some commercial experience with machine learning and
      iOS development.<p>

      <p>Moreover I am a strong advocate of the DevOps movement with a great in
      interest in improved communication across disaplines. I believe that
      DevOps should not be defined in terms of tools but instead as a cultural
      shift.</p>

      <p>In my spare time I occasionally blog about technology, bake all sorts
      of treats, dine at the nearest burger restaruant at the time, and dabble
      in 3D printing and electronics.</p>
