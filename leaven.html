      <h3>A sourdough platform</h3>
      <p>Maintain sourdough cultures through a simple and fluid design, made with bakers in mind. No more spreadsheets or calculators required when baking sourdough.</p>

      <h3>Knows your starter</h3>
      <p>Manage multiple cultures without needing to memorise individual culture traits. Leaven keeps track of details like: flour and water weights; container weights; typical activation time; and starter hydration.</p>

      <h3>It's free</h3>
      <p>Leaven is a free app, but I will accept donations through the form of baked goods ;-)</p>

      <h3>Question?</h3>
      <p>Send comments, questions and bugs through <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> and I will endeavour to reply as quickly as possible.</p>
