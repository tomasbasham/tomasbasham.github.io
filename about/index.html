      <p>A computer scientist by profession, I hold a First Class Honours Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science from Cardiff University. I started my career within the University itself having undertaken research projects and participated in several of the research groups.</p>

      <p>Having always been a highly motivated individual, this led me to enrol within the Alacrity Foundation. A startup incubator that boast to be a collaboration between the Welsh Government, The Waterloo Foundation and the Wesley Clover Corporation. Here I developed practical business skills and thrived as a entrepreneur to ultimately co-found my own demand-driven technology company.</p>

      <p>Now the Technical Director at whichledlight.com, I am responsible for defining the technological strategy with our development team; assessing technical risk and mitigation planning whilst identifying weak software systems that need code improvement; establishing standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression; evaluating new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and development excellence and creating automated test process for system features, where possible.</p>

      <p>With experience within development operations, I also take up the responsibility of maintaining our production infrastructure and deployment procedures.</p>

      <p>Still in the early stages of the startup process whichledlight.com is currently undergoing a radical change in front end technology, using the latest in single page application frameworks.</p>
