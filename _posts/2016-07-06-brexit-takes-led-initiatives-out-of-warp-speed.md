The vote for Britain to leave the European Union may delay benefits UK
households would receive as a result of switching to energy efficient LED
lighting.

Post Brexit it is expected the UK to suffer huge delays in adopting new EU
backed initiatives as government trawls through 40 years of legislation it now
has to reimplement itself. This includes employment and labour laws, as well as
energy efficiency regulations to name just a few.

In regards to energy efficiency, and lighting products specifically, after the
European Commission introduced
[EC244/2009](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:076:0003:0016:en:PDF)
for non-directional household halogen and fluorescent lightbulbs and
[EC245/2009](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:076:0017:0044:en:PDF)
for fluorescent tubes, ballasts and luminaires respectively in 2009, it
inaugurated
[EU1194/2012](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:342:0001:0022:en:PDF)
for all remaining LED and directional light sources. These demanded a wholesale
shift to more energy efficient lighting solutions by September 2016, including
LED lighting.

However having already seen [pushbacks to
2018](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/20/eu-delays-ban-on-halogen-bulbs)
and the lighting sector being [excluded from stricter
regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/12/lightbulbs-lighting-excluded-eu-regulations-energy-efficiency-advertising)
Brexit may now deliver another blow to a growing LED market by excluding itself
from the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) where the UK can
currently participate in the development and maintenance of voluntary industry
standards.

Consequently this is likely to affect UK households that could benefit from the
significant energy savings these products provide. Energy efficient lightbulbs
are already as cheap or cheaper than they were expected to be in 2025. This
means many could see a return on investment (ROI) within the first year of
purchasing an LED product. This is in costrast to only a couple of years ago
when an ROI may not have been realised for 2-3 years.

Leading consumer brands and professional lighting companies have taken note of
an LED industry currently at warp speed, with [IKEA committing to only sell LED
lamps](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/10/ikea-ditches-conventional-lightbulbs-for-energy-saving-led-lighting)
from September 2015 and [whichledlight.com](https://www.whichledlight.com)
providing an independent LED comparison website aimed to educate and organise
many consumer retrofit products including
[G9](https://www.whichledlight.com/t/g9-led-bulbs),
[GU10](https://www.whichledlight.com/t/gu10-led-bulbs) and
[E27](https://www.whichledlight.com/t/e27-led-bulbs) LED lightbulbs.
Unfortunately they may not see mass uptake if the UK is not ruling out
traditional technologies for some time to come, since it is still often cheaper
to buy halogen lightbulbs and too difficult to break consumer habits.

It is certainly not the end for more energy efficient LED products, but is
going to have to be a consumer led initiative at least for the near future. If
we are to see huge savings in electricity consumption and a break in consumer
habits, further educational materials are need to prevent consumers reaching
for conventional, cheaper, but often more wasteful alternatives.
