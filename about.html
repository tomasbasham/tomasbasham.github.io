      <p>My name is Tomas Basham. I am the Technical Director at <a href="https://www.whichledlight.com">Which LED Light</a>; an independent LED comparison web application.</p>

      <p>I have a strong programming skill set with particular attention to Ruby and JavaScript, focussing on Ruby on Rails and emberjs.</p>

      <p>In my spare time I occasionally blog about technology, bake all sorts of treats, and dabble in 3D printing and electronics.</p>
