      <p>A graduate from Cardiff University having achieved a first-class honours degree in Computer Science, I have since worked in a variety of technology led startups and diverse project teams. I am currently an employee, and Technical Director, at <a href="https://www.whichledlight.com">WhichLEDLight</a>: an independent LED comparison web application.</p>

      <p>I have a strong programming skill set with particular attention to JavaScript and other front end development tools, focussing on emberjs. However I have commercial experience with iOS development both in Objective-C and Swift, Ruby on Rails, C/C++ and a little of Python.</p>

      <p>Each of my projects upholds a high standard toward code quality and testing that carries beyond the workplace where I have created many open source projects that may be found on <a href="https://github.com/tomasbasham?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>Furthermore I am a strong advocate of the DevOps movement with a great interest in containerisation, within which I believe all modern applications would benefit.</p>

      <p>I am currently responsible for defining the technological strategy with our development team; assessing technical risk and mitigation planning whilst identifying weak software systems that need code improvement; establishing standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression; evaluating new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and creating automated test process for system features.</p>

      <p>Outside of the office I occasionally blog about technology or current affairs realting to technology, am a keen baker and like to dabble in 3D printing and electronics.</p>
