Last year the team at Netflix posted a tutorial on how to create your own [Netflix switch](https://makeit.netflix.com/the-switch). At first glance this guide is very comprehensive and supplies all the necessary guidance and files required to start from nothing to your very own Netflix automation device. Through this article we discover that this is not quite the case.

### Materials list

The [materials list](https://makeit.netflix.com/downloads/build_step2_MaterialsList.pdf) posted on the Netflix blog is somewhat unfinished and sometimes refers to items that were built inhouse, such as the momentary arcade button. It also makes no reference to the type of material used to create the outer enclosure and inner chassis which are some of the most important, and most difficult pieces, of the entire build. For the most part this materials list will get you going but I have compiled my own which I feel to be a lot more complete.

<table border="1" width="100%" style="text-align:center; margin: 10px 0;">
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Qty</th>
    <th>Merchant</th>
    <th>Part Number</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Particle Core</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Particle.io</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Momentary Arcade Button http://www.arcadeworlduk.com/products/awuk-rgb-colour-changing-illuminated-arcade-button.html</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>AWUK</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
